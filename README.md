The data_sample.csv file includes data for a supply chain. The column EstimatedCost is the estimate provided by the supply chain consultant experts (e.g. $1000 Per Ton) of the Final Product, before delivering to the customer each month. The three other columns are the actual costs of Raw Materials Cost, Workmanship Cost, and Storage Cost in the warehouse. Use JavaScript (or Python), to calculate the margin of profit for each month considering the final price sold Estimate cost x 1.1.

ActualCost = Raw Material Cost + Workmanship Cost + Storage Cost
SoldPrice =  Estimate Cost x 1.1
MarginOfProfit  = Sold Price -  Actual Cost
